# Assignment 2 - Classifying Traffic signs using a CNN

## Overview

This repository consists of the code and data used to train a convolutional neural network for image recognition of traffic signs. 'CNN.py' and 'mysweep.yaml' were used to carry out different hyperparameter training sweeps through Weights and Biases to support finding the best model. The training and validation used for these runs is stored in the `./input` directory but have been removed for the submission as they are very large and were not required for the submission. The `./final_model` directory holds the saved Keras model for the best model found during hyperparameter sweeps as well as supporting logs and metrics generated by Weights and Biases.

## Reproducing Test Results

To reproduce the test results reported, navigate into the root directory and run `python TestScriptSubset.py`. The script will take some time to load in the model and then display a summary of each layer of the architecture. It will then run a short prediction making and matching process before displaying the 'Test data loss value' and 'Test data accuracy'result below.
